For many students, planning out their major courses for four years reliably is always tough.  Some people choose to not interact with their counselors.  Others are not able to connect with others in their major.  A community-driven network of students, as well as a centralized information about classes should  help students gain access to the resources they need to plan their classes, connect with their major more intimately, and succeed in their undergraduate career.
